This is where my love for math and problem solving began. I enjoy looking at problems, building things, and finding a way to use math to solve those problems. I hope to impart this joy to my students. </li>

My favorite to play are soccer and basketball. My favorite to watch are soccer and football. However, I love to watch all sports. The Olympics are my favorite thing to watch. I hope to attend one day. Please, start a conversation about sports with me! </li>
